- 👋 Hi, I’m @CodeBoy-source
- 👀 I’m interested in ComputerScience and problem solving overral.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ComputerScience at the top 3 University in Spain, The University of Granada.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with everyone on everything I can, since I am very open-minded and love to learn random stuff!

CodeBoy-source/CodeBoy-source is a ✨ special ✨ repository because for now It doesn't have much, but it's plan for the future are huge.
For now I'm only able to upload those kind of exercise that I didn't have the luck of losing and have the right to upload (University Policy or something).
But perhaps on the future I could use this for more advanced practises or maybe for some fun projects I will end up doing anyway.
Notice: Not all code here I am proud, I have learned and developed a lot more skills since my first day. I learn something new everyday. 
        But as a reminder of my HardWork and progress I will blindly upload everything asking for forgiveness and no jugdgement on most mistakes if you are so kind.
That's all folks, have a nice day!
